# Progress

A running account of what is being worked on and what came out of it. Kept in the repo rather than
in a chat log so it survives the session that produced it.

## Checked facts

<!-- EVERY NUMBER BELOW IS RECOMPUTED BY tools/progress_check.sh, WHICH RUNS IN ctest.
     They are measured against `as-of-commit`, not against your working tree, so you can commit
     freely and catch this file up in one go — but not indefinitely: the check also refuses when
     HEAD has drifted more than a dozen commits past it.
     Run `bash tools/progress_check.sh` and it prints the values to paste. -->

- as-of-commit: 7607bc1
- main-cpp-lines: 15261
- ctest-entries: 161

## Why this file cannot quietly go stale

Because it is not maintained by remembering. Three separate mechanisms, none of which is a habit:

1. **The numbers are recomputed.** `tools/progress_check.sh` reads `as-of-commit`, checks out those
   three facts from *that commit's* tree, and fails if any of them disagrees with what is written
   here. Wrong numbers are a red suite, not a stale document.
2. **Drift is bounded.** `as-of-commit` must be an ancestor of HEAD and within `MAX_DRIFT` commits
   of it. Stop updating and the suite goes red on its own, without anyone noticing first.
3. **Citations are already checked.** This file lives in `docs/`, so `tools/doc_citation_check.sh`
   applies to it: no line-number citations, and every source file and symbol it names must
   actually exist. That is the rule that catches the actual failure mode — a claim about the code
   that stopped being true.

   That rule caught this very paragraph within a minute of it being written: the sentence
   originally spelled out a placeholder path to illustrate the format, and the check flagged it,
   because a check reading prose cannot tell a mention from a use. The fix is to stop naming an
   example rather than to add an exemption — a rule that has to dodge its own text is telling you
   something about its precision, and an exemption would be the first hole in it.

**What none of this can do is make the prose useful.** A check can force the numbers to be honest
and the file to be recent; it cannot force the narrative to say anything worth reading. That part
is a judgement call every time, and pretending otherwise would be the same mistake as a comment
that claims to be a guarantee.

The reason it is built this way: every stale claim found in this repo was in a file somebody
*intended* to keep current. `tools/meter_bar_check.sh` carried "THE ANCHOR IS NOT FIXED" for months
after it was fixed — stale in the direction that gets work done twice, by someone with no reason to
suspect the first attempt exists.

## 2026-08-02/03 — engine refactor and the bugs it surfaced

`apps/daw_engine_main.cpp` went **20,387 → 15,261 lines** across 50 commits, each gated on a full
ctest and a byte-identical offline render. The suite went 149 → 161 entries, and 426 unit
assertions now exist in modules that previously had none.

**Structure.** 16 command modules extracted from `handleUiEntry` (5,604 → ~1,530 lines);
`apps/engine_types.h` for 25 types that had been declared *inside* `main()`; `apps/engine_pure.h`
and `apps/engine_rt_helpers.h` for rules that can now be tested without booting a process. Four
unit-test binaries where there were none. A command module rebuilds in 4.2s against 13.5s to
relink the engine.

**The grade is still C, and the binding constraint is not the part that was moved.** A four-judge
panel put it plainly: `main()` is ~13,700 lines, and the producer lambda still holds `renderTrack`,
`processTrack` and `emitNotes`. The command extraction took the half that was already a flat
sequence of independent arms; the entangled half is being mined for testable rules rather than
moved wholesale.

**A 6-line duplicate-block scan over `main.cpp` has yet to find a duplication that was actually
identical**, which is why it keeps producing bugs rather than tidying:

- **Placement reach** was answered in five places, three different ways. Two guards each existed at
  exactly *one* site, and each one's comment documented the bug that motivated it: a freshly
  created clip's placement measured as *empty* everywhere except the published extent, and a
  saturating add that three copies lacked — one of which feeds the ripple-refusal decision, where
  a wrapped end silently accepts or refuses a time edit.
- **A device with no `capability_mask` loaded as a device with no capabilities.** An absent field
  defaulted to 0, so the device loaded without complaint, appeared in the chain, and was inert.
  Only hand-authored projects were affected — which is most of the fixtures here.
- **The hazard-pointer acquire** existed in three verbatim copies of a lock-free protocol, with a
  comment defending the duplication that said "both sites" while there were three.
- **The loop rules** are where duplication was *kept*: a seek clamps where the transport wraps, so
  they stayed three named functions whose tests assert they disagree.

**Two instrument failures cost more than any of the bugs.** `sampler_vintage` failed the engine for
being correct — its assertion was a proxy that only held when the sample-and-hold period was not a
whole number of frames, and connecting Bluetooth headphones moved the default output device from
44.1k to 48k. That led to `--sample-rate` on the offline render (a bounce previously took whatever
was plugged in), which in turn exposed a second copy of the sample rate: `effSampleRate` read the
device directly while `baseConfig` carried its own — the same config-versus-pump divergence
`--block-size` had already been repaired for, one field away.

## Open, and needing a decision rather than work

- **Published meter points carry the requested tick, not the effective one.** `setMap` snaps a
  signature change forward to the next bar line; the wire publishes the tick that was *asked for*.
  Measured: 3/4 requested at 5 quarters, published as 5, actually begins at 8. Fixing it properly
  means widening `UiTimeSigPoint` and bumping `kShmVersion`, which the equality gate turns into a
  forced rebuild on both sides — so it needs coordination, not just code.
- **PDC clamps every event in the first `latencySamples_` to sample 0**, collapsing their relative
  timing. Three candidate fixes, and choosing among them is an owner's call.
